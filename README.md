# animation
Here is the Assignment for this week. I added the Standart Assets and the Animation is in the week05_Assignment Folder. It is a sphere that moves in the shape of the "House of Nicolaus". No idea if this is also a thing in Korea, otherwise here is an illustration (I have no rights to the image) (The clue is, you start in the lower left corner and try to draw it with only one line (no doubles) to the right lower corner, (I double the lower Edge for aesthetical reasons). You can control the animation with z,u,i.
