# animation
Here is the Assignment for this week. I added the Standart Assets and the Animation is in the week05_Assignment Folder. It is a sphere that moves in the shape of the "House of Nicolaus". No idea if this is also a thing in Korea, otherwise here is an illustration (I have no rights to the image).
